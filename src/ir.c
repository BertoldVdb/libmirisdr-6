/*
 * The remote control receiver input on GPIO_3.
 *
 * The hardware measures pulse widths and nothing else, leaving the protocol to
 * the application.  Register 0x0A bit 16 runs it and the low 16 bits are the
 * prescaler, the counter clocking at 24 MHz / (N + 1).  What it produces
 * arrives in the stream rather than over the control endpoint, in header byte 6
 * of every 1024 byte packet, and that byte carries two different things:
 *
 *   - when a run ends, its level in bit 7 - set when the input was low - and
 *     its length in ticks in the low seven bits;
 *   - when the run in progress reaches 128 ticks without ending, the live input
 *     level in bit 7 and 127 in the low seven bits.  The counter then restarts,
 *     so this repeats every 128 ticks until the level finally changes, and the
 *     length latched at that point is only the time since the last one.
 *
 * So 127 is not a length, it is "still going, here is the level", and a run
 * longer than full scale has to be timed with the help of the header's sample
 * counter, which is exact and has no range limit.  How, and why that costs
 * nothing in resolution, is below.
 *
 * That changes what the prescaler is for.  It does not have to be large enough
 * to hold the longest run of interest, only large enough that a counter cycle
 * spans more than two packets, which is what keeps the number of restarts
 * recoverable; past that, smaller is simply finer.  The slowest packet the
 * hardware allows is 768 samples at 1.3 Msps, 591 us, so a tick above 9.2 us
 * works at every rate and format.
 *
 * The other extreme is useful too: with the tick at its minimum every run of
 * any length passes full scale almost at once, so byte 6 becomes a plain level
 * sample once per packet and transitions are timed by the stream alone - which
 * is enough to read a UART, or anything else slower than a packet.
 *
 * The one real limit is that byte 6 arrives once per packet, so a run shorter
 * than a packet period can be overwritten before it is ever seen.  At 8 Msps
 * and 252 samples that is 31.5 us.  It is also why this only works while
 * streaming.
 *
 * A run longer than the counter is still measured exactly.  The count latched
 * when it ends is its tail, restarts are exactly 128 ticks apart, and the
 * header's sample counter says how much time actually passed - so the number of
 * restarts is the only unknown and rounding recovers it.  That is the whole of
 * the arithmetic below, and it is worth more than it looks: it gives the length
 * to within a tick rather than to within a packet, for runs of any length.
 *
 * One callback per packet, always describing the run in progress and, on the
 * packet where it ends, its final length.  Reporting only completed runs would
 * be less to explain and worse to use, because a run is only known to have
 * ended when the next edge arrives: a UART character that ended in ones, or the
 * gap between two remote control frames, would never be reported at all, and
 * nothing downstream could tell either from a receiver that had gone quiet.
